# Problem Set 1

Consider a model of vertical differentiation similar to Bresnahan (1987). Each consumer $i$ has utility for product $j$ given by

$$u_{ij} = \delta_j - \alpha_ip_j$$

where $\delta_j$ is product quality and $\alpha_i$ is distributed exponential with parameter $\lambda$. 


## Question 1

The market share of good $j$, $S_j$, is equal to the probability that a consumer chooses good $j$ over all other goods. Because of the vertical structure, the outside good is compared only against the lowest-quality good:

$$S_0(\lambda) = P(\delta_j / p_j \leq \alpha_i) = 1 - P(\alpha_i < \delta_j/p_j)$$

Given that $\alpha_i$ is distributed exponential, this is equivalent to

$$

Solving for the $\delta$s as a function of observed market shares, prices, and $\lambda$ yields


## Question 2

```{r}
rm(list = ls())

library(data.table)
library(here)

dt <- fread(here("Mortimer HW", "data", "ps1_data_nohead.txt"))
names(dt) <- c("price", "quantity", "weight", "hp", "ac", "firmId")

```
